To implement Expectation Maximization routine for learning parameters of a Hidden Markov Model, to be able to use the EM framework for deriving
algorithms for the problems with hidden or partial information..

PROBLEM STATEMENTS -

1) Read through the reference carefully. Implement routines for learning the parameters of
HMM given in section 7. In section 8, "A notso-simple example", an interesting exercise is
carried out. Perform a similar experiment on
"War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy.

2) Ten bent (biased) coins are placed in a box
with unknown bias values. A coin is randomly picked from the box and tossed 100
times. A file containing results of five hundred such instances is presented in tabular
form with 1 indicating head and 0 indicating tail. Find out the unknown bias values. (2020_ten_bent_coins.csv) To help you, a
sample code for two bent coin problem along
with data is made available in the work folder:
two_bent_coins.csv and embentcoinsol.m

3) A point set with real value is given
in 2020_em_clustering.csv. Considering that
there are two clusters, use EM to group together points belonging to the same cluster.
Try and argue that k-means is an EM algorithm
